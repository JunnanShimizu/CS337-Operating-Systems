    "In this project, we implemented four different attempts to solve software synchronization solutions, and tested if each satisfied mutual exclusion, progress, bounded wait-time, and can run with multiple threads. We found out that 'solution' one satisfied mutual exclusion, but not progress, 'solution' two satisfied mutual exclusion and progress, but not bounded wait-time, and Peterson's Solution satisfied mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded, wait-time, and Bakery's solution satisfied all four criteria, mutual exlusion, progress, bounded wait-time, and the use of multiple threads. \n",

    "We know this first 'solution' guarantees mutual exclusion because the iteration count is as it should be. If we look at the first simulation of this notebook, we can see the iteration count should be 2000000 as each thread (in this case two threads) runs the increment method 1000000 times each, so the count should be 2000000, however, this is clearly not the case. This is because in the first simulation, there are times when the threads access the critical section (which is the increment function) at the same time which affects the count accuracy. This, however, is prevented in the first 'solution' by implementing a lock, and this is reflected in our accurate counts (the low iteration count is due to the length of time the code takes to run).\n",
